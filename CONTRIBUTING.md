### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding guidelines
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FlowSense.ai.git
cd FlowSense.ai
```

2. **Create a branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. **Setup backend**:
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Setup frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

5. **Make your changes**

6. **Test your changes**:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m pytest  # if tests exist

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

**Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8
```bash
# Install linters
pip install flake8 black

# Format code
black .

# Check style
flake8 .
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle exceptions properly

Example:
```python
def count_vehicles(frame: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Count vehicles in a frame using YOLOv8.
    
    Args:
        frame: Input image frame as numpy array
        
    Returns:
        Number of vehicles detected
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

**Style Guide**: Use ESLint configuration provided

```bash
# Format code
npm run lint

# Check for errors
npm run build
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use prop-types or TypeScript for type checking
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names

Example:
```jsx
function VehicleCounter({ count, lane }) {
  return (
    <div className="vehicle-counter">
      <span>{lane}: {count} vehicles</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Git Commit Messages

**Format**:
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat: add emergency vehicle priority detection

Added YOLOv8 model extension to detect emergency vehicles
and give them signal priority in the adaptive algorithm.

Closes #123
```

```
fix: resolve memory leak in video processing

Fixed issue where video frames were not properly released,
causing memory usage to grow over time.
```
