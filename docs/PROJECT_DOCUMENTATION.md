## Executive Summary

FlowSense.ai is an intelligent traffic management system that leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision to optimize traffic flow at intersections. The system uses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect and count vehicles in real-time across four lanes (North, South, East, West). Based on the traffic density, it dynamically adjusts signal timing to minimize wait times and reduce congestion.

The project demonstrates practical application of AI in solving real-world problems and contributes to smart city infrastructure development.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in urban areas worldwide, leading to:
- Economic losses due to productivity decline
- Increased fuel consumption and costs
- Higher carbon emissions and air pollution
- Driver frustration and road rage incidents
- Emergency vehicle delays

Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timing cycles that don't adapt to real-time traffic conditions, resulting in inefficient road utilization.

### 1.2 Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from:
1. **Urban Development**: Rapid urbanization increasing vehicle density
2. **Environmental Concerns**: Need to reduce emissions through efficient traffic flow
3. **Technological Advancement**: Availability of powerful AI/ML tools
4. **Smart City Vision**: Integration of AI in city infrastructure
5. **Academic Interest**: Application of computer vision in practical scenarios

### 1.3 Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
- Develop a real-time vehicle detection system using YOLOv8
- Implement adaptive traffic signal timing algorithm
- Create an intuitive web-based monitoring dashboard
- Achieve 30-40% reduction in average wait time

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Integrate cloud logging for traffic analytics
- Support multiple video input sources
- Optimize for Apple Silicon (M-series) chips
- Create comprehensive documentation

### 3.3 Algorithm Design

**Adaptive Timing Algorithm:**

```
Input: lane_counts = {North: n, South: s, East: e, West: w}
Output: signal_timings = {North: t_n, South: t_s, East: t_e, West: t_w}

Constants:
  MIN_TIME = 15 seconds
  MAX_TIME = 90 seconds
  TOTAL_CYCLE_TIME = 120 seconds

Algorithm:
1. Calculate total_vehicles = n + s + e + w
2. If total_vehicles == 0:
     Assign default timing (30s each)
3. Else:
     For each lane:
       proportion = lane_count / total_vehicles
       time_allocated = TOTAL_CYCLE_TIME × proportion
       Apply constraints: time = max(MIN_TIME, min(MAX_TIME, time_allocated))
4. Return signal_timings
```
